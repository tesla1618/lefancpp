# LEFAN

**L**inear **E**quations and **F**unction **AN**alysis

LEFAN is a c++ based math calculator. We have tried to use logics and arguments to build a *almost* useful tool for the people who share love for geometry and maths. Mathematics indeed has always been the greatest field of study till current date And since Maths and Programming are both accompany each other, So the project LEFAN not only made us writing lines of codes, but also helping us on developing critical analysis, logic building understanding a lot of untouched *by us* features of programming and mathematics.
